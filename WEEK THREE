Learning hours:7 hours
This week ,I reviewed the knowledge that I learned and prepared for the coming test.I did more pratice and improved my coding skills.Though I still can't solve many difficult
problems ,I kept studying until I mastered it.Coding is really a hard work ,especially for people like me,who didn't have any coding skills and don't know anything of it before
,but I will keep learning.
