WEEK ONE
                                          
I’ve learned for maybe 8 hours this week.Because I’m just a beginner , I need to take some time to adapt to it.I master a big part of C programming language,which ranges from the beginning to the arrays by listening to online classes. For the better understanding of it ,I also did some programming practise. As a beginner ,it can be hard to fully understand the programming language and change my mindset to programming language ,but I will try my best to adapt to it.
For the next week ,I will finish the language learning and try to figure out Linux.I believe I will master it.
WEEK TWO

I learned the required content of c language and did some practice .I have trouble dealing with some questions which require a high understanding of for ciculation.But I will practice mor to master it .I also learned the basic information of LINUX.It is hard to master because I have never been exposed to it before but I will try my best to understand it.
